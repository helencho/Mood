## Author's Notes  

**Smood** is the product of a passion project assignment at Coalition for Queens. I took this opportunity to experiment with new tools, most notably Redux, Recharts, file structure/organization patterns, and emojis. I wanted to push my limits and get my hands dirty with technologies I've never used before. I wanted to go outside of my usual white-background-clean-font pattern. 

**Smood** is a result of these experimentations.
